# AI-Powered-Deepfake-Detection-System
Detect AI-generated and manipulated facial images and videos in real time using deep learning.

## About
DeepFake Detection is a full-stack AI application that identifies whether an image or video contains a synthetically generated or manipulated human face. Built as a Final Year Project, it combines a fine-tuned Xception convolutional neural network with a FastAPI backend and a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend — making state-of-the-art deepfake detection accessible to non-technical users through a clean web interface.
As deepfake technology becomes increasingly accessible, the ability to verify the authenticity of visual media is critical for journalists, researchers, and the general public. This project addresses that need with a fast, accurate, and deployable detection tool.

## Features
Image Detection — Upload any portrait photo and receive a REAL or FAKE verdict with a confidence score in under 500ms.

Video Detection — Upload a video clip for frame-by-frame analysis with per-frame confidence breakdown and overall verdict.

Face-Focused Analysis — Haar cascade face detection isolates the facial region before classification, improving accuracy.

Real-Time Results — Animated confidence bar, natural-language explanation, and instant visual feedback.

Privacy First — Uploaded files are permanently deleted immediately after prediction — nothing is stored.

Drag and Drop — Intuitive upload interface with live preview for both images and videos.

REST API — Full FastAPI backend with documented endpoints, usable independently of the frontend.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites

-Python 3.12 (required for CUDA support)

-NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.1 (recommended)


## Installation

### Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-detection.git

cd deepfake-detection


### Install dependencies

py -3.12 -m pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

py -3.12 -m pip install timm albumentations opencv-python scikit-learn fastapi uvicorn python-multipart


## Usage

Step 1 — Prepare dataset (merge image + video datasets)

py -3.12 prepare_dataset.py


Step 2 — Train the model

py -3.12 train.py --epochs 15


Step 3 — Start the API

py -3.12 -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000


Step 4 — Serve the frontend

py -3.12 -m http.server 3000

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.


## API Endpoints
Method        Endpoint      Description
GET            /            Health check
POST          /predict      Detect deepfake in an image (max 50MB)
POST      /predict-video    Detect deepfake in a video (max 200MB)

## Example
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -F "file=@face.jpg"

  {
  "prediction": "FAKE",
  "confidence": 94.7
}

## How It Works?

-User uploads an image or video through the web interface

-The file is sent to the FastAPI backend via a multipart POST request

-OpenCV's Haar cascade detects and crops the largest face region

-The face crop is normalised and passed through the fine-tuned Xception model

-A softmax confidence score is returned — REAL or FAKE

-The uploaded file is immediately deleted from the server

-The result is displayed with an animated confidence bar
